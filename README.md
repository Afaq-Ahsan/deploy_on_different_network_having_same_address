This contract is for deploying a same contract on different Networks but they Should have Unique addresses
To deploy contract on different networks we must need to follow these rules


make new Account on each chain from your metamask wallet and add faucets in it do this for each chain because each account have nonce should be zero 

you need to make alchemy accounts whatever you want for example
1. Goerli testnet 
2. Arbitrum Goerli
3. Optimism Goerli
4. Polygon

make 4 apps and paste theire private keys on .env files
also get the private key of deployer address and also paste it on .env file



I also deploy a simple contract on different 4 networks having same address and also varify them

1. Goerli testnet 
2. Arbitrum Goerli
3. Optimism Goerli
4. Polygon


1. Goerli testnet  =  https://goerli.etherscan.io/address/0x394c598512c1e1c0621953e937ea508dbf195284
2. Arbitrum Goerli =  https://testnet.arbiscan.io/address/0x394c598512C1e1C0621953e937EA508dBF195284
3. Optimism Goerli =  https://blockscout.com/optimism/goerli/address/0x394c598512C1e1C0621953e937EA508dBF195284
4. Polygon         =  https://mumbai.polygonscan.com/address/0x394c598512c1e1c0621953e937ea508dbf195284
